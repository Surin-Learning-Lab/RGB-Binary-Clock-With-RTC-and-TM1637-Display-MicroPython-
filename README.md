# RGB-Binary-Clock-With-RTC-and-TM1637-Display-MicroPython-
Designed and implemented a multi-display real-time clock using MicroPython with a DS3231 RTC, TM1637 display, and shift-register-driven RGB LED arrays, developing custom drivers to synchronize multiple hardware interfaces, implementing real-time binary visualization with color-mapped time segmentation.
